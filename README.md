🚀 Startup War Simulator

A turn-based, strategy-driven startup management simulator powered by Groq LLM.

Built with a hybrid deterministic engine + large language model reasoning to simulate real startup economics, risk exposure, and survival dynamics over a 12-month lifecycle.

🔥 Live Concept

The player runs a startup for 12 months and must survive by making strategic decisions under:

Cash constraints

Burn rate pressure

Investor trust volatility

Team morale decay

Market competition

Product quality tradeoffs

Lose Conditions

Cash ≤ 0

Team morale ≤ 20

Investor trust ≤ 15

Win Condition

Survive 12 months

🧠 Architecture Overview

This is not a simple “LLM chatbot wrapper.”

It uses a Hybrid Game Engine Design:

Deterministic Engine (Local)

Handles predictable economic mechanics:

Monthly burn

Risk index scaling

Deterministic internal events (every 3 months)

Failure checks

Achievement logic

LLM Reasoning Layer (Groq)

Used only for:

Strategic event generation

Major economic decision evaluation

Complex macroeconomic reasoning

Compressed State Format (Token Optimized)

Instead of sending full JSON to the LLM:

M3 | C:75000 | B:14000 | U:2300 | G:8 | M:62 | T:70 | R:48

This reduces token usage and improves response speed.

Hidden Traits System

Each startup receives randomized hidden strategic traits at initialization which influence long-term outcomes.

Risk Index

Aggressive decisions increase systemic risk which compounds over time.

Deterministic Internal Events

Every 3 months:

Market correction

Operational stress

Competitive shift

No API call required.

🧪 Production Considerations

This system includes:

Rate limit backoff handling

Safe JSON parsing from LLM responses

Token usage optimization

Defensive API validation

Controlled temperature for analytical outputs

LLMs are non-deterministic. The engine is built to guard against malformed outputs.

📊 Why This Project Matters

This is not a toy UI wrapper around an LLM.

It demonstrates:

Hybrid AI system design

Token efficiency optimization

Serverless backend architecture

Game loop lifecycle management

State compression strategy

Production-level error handling

🧩 Future Improvements

Persistent score leaderboard

Multi-player competitive mode

Difficulty scaling

Real macroeconomic data injection

Investor sentiment modeling

Offline deterministic-only mode
